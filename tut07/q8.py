# "Modify the cat program from the previous question so that it also
# accepts a -v command line option to display all characters in the file
# in printable form.
#
# In particular, end of lines should be shown by a $ symbol (useful for
# finding trailing whitespace in lines) and all control characters
# (ascii code less than 32) should be shown as ^X (where X is the
# printable character obtained by adding the code for 'A' to the control
# character code). So, for example, tabs (ascii code 9) should display
# as ^I."
